/*In this solution, regular expression ^[A-Z] is used to check (test) if the first character of before is uppercase.
If first letter of before is capitalized, change the first letter of after to uppercase.
Else: If first letter of before is lowercase, change the first letter of after to lowercase
Return the new string replacing before with after.*/
