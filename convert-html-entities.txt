/*Create an object to use the Lookup functionality and easily find the characters.
Split the original string by characters and use map to check for the changed html entity or use the same one.
The a function is added which is what returns the converted entity or the original one if there is no conversion.
Lastly we join all the characters once again.
Note that if you went the regex route then you donâ€™t need to join anything, just make sure you return the whole operation or save it to a variable and then return it.*/
