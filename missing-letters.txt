/*This solutions makes use of a for loop.
Code of encountered character is stored in code.
It is checked if code of current character is the expected one (no characters are skipped) by using the logic - code of current character = code of first character + number of iterations.
If a character is missing, the missing character is found and the final string is returned.
undefined is returned if there is no missing character in the string.*/
